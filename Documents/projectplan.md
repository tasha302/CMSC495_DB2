    Projected Budget

    Project Budget is classified in Three Sections:

    Risk Assessment

    The initial **Risk Assessment** (following page) attempts to
    identify, characterize, prioritize and document a mitigation
    approach relative to those risks which can be identified prior to
    the start of the project.

    The **Risk Assessment** will be continuously monitored and updated
    throughout the life of the project, with monthly assessments
    included in the status report (see **Communications Plan**) and open
    to amendment by the Project Manager.

    Because mitigation approaches must be agreed upon by project
    leadership (based on the assessed impact of the risk, the project's
    ability to accept the risk, and the feasibility of mitigating the
    risk), it is necessary to allocate time into each Steering Committee
    meeting, dedicated to identifying new risks and discussing
    mitigation strategies.

ASSUMPTIONS

Project Assumptions

The following assumptions were made in preparing the DB2 Inventory
Management Project Plan:

38. Business employees are willing to change business operations to take
    advantage of the functionality offered by the new mobile technology.

39. Management will ensure that project team members are available as
    needed to complete project tasks and objectives.

40. Each Committee will participate in the timely execution of the
    Project Plan (i.e., timely approval cycles and meeting when
    required).

41. Failure to identify changes to draft deliverables within the time
    specified in the project timeline will result in project delays.

42. Project team members will adhere to the Communications Plan.

43. Mid and upper management will foster support and "buy-in" of project
    goals and objectives.

44. All project participants will abide by the guidelines identified
    within this plan.

45. The Project Plan may change as new information and issues are
    revealed.

Issue Management

The information contained within the DB2 Inventory Management Project
Plan will likely change as the project progresses. While change is both
certain and required, it is important to note that any changes to the
Project Plan will impact at least one of three critical success factors:
Available Time, Available Resources (Financial, Personnel), or Project
Quality. The decision by which to make modifications to the Project Plan
(including project scope and resources) should be coordinated using the
following process:

**Step 1:** As soon as a change which impacts project scope, schedule,
staffing or spending is identified, the Team Member will communicate
with everyone.

**Step 2:** The Project Manager will review the change and determine the
associated impact to the project and will forward the issue, along with
a recommendation, to the Steering Committee for review and decision.

**Step 3:** Upon receipt, the Steering Committee should reach a
consensus opinion on whether to approve, reject or modify the request
based upon the information contained within the project website, the
Project Manager's recommendation and their own judgment. Should the
Steering Committee be unable to reach consensus on the approval or
denial of a change, the issue will be forwarded to the Project Sponsor,
with a written summation of the issue, for ultimate resolution.

**Step 4:** If required under the decision matrix or due to a lack of
consensus, the Project Sponsor shall review the issue(s) and render a
final decision on the approval or denial of a change.

**Step 5:** Following an approval or denial (by the Steering Committee
or Project Sponsor), the Project Manager will notify the original
requestor of the action taken. There is no appeal process.

Communications Plan

Disseminating knowledge about the project is essential to the project's
success. Project participants desire knowledge of what the status of the
project is and how they are affected. Furthermore, they are anxious to
participate. The more that people are educated about the progress of the
project and how it will help them in the future, the more they are
likely to participate and benefit.

This plan provides a framework for informing, involving, and obtaining
buy-in from all participants throughout the duration of the project.

**[Audience]{.underline}** This communication plan is for the following
audiences:

47. Team Members

    **[Communications Methodology]{.underline}** The communications
    methodology utilizes three directions for effective communication:

### **[Top-Down]{.underline}** It is absolutely crucial that all participants in this project sense the executive support and guidance for this effort. The executive leadership of the organization needs to speak with a unified, enthusiastic voice about the project and what it holds for everyone involved. This will be \'hands-on\' change management, if it is to be successful. Not only will the executives need to speak directly to all levels of the organization, they will also need to listen directly to all levels of the organization, as well. {#top-down-it-is-absolutely-crucial-that-all-participants-in-this-project-sense-the-executive-support-and-guidance-for-this-effort.-the-executive-leadership-of-the-organization-needs-to-speak-with-a-unified-enthusiastic-voice-about-the-project-and-what-it-holds-for-everyone-involved.-this-will-be-hands-on-change-management-if-it-is-to-be-successful.-not-only-will-the-executives-need-to-speak-directly-to-all-levels-of-the-organization-they-will-also-need-to-listen-directly-to-all-levels-of-the-organization-as-well. .ListParagraph}

The transition from the project management practices of today to the
practices envisioned for tomorrow will be driven by a sure and convinced
leadership focused on a vision and guided by clearly defined, strategic,
measurable goals.

### **[Bottom-Up]{.underline}** To ensure the buy-in and confidence of the personnel involved in bringing the proposed changes to reality, it will be important to communicate the way in which the solutions were created. If the perception in the organization is that only the Steering Committee created the proposed changes, resistance is likely to occur. However, if it is understood that all participants were consulted, acceptance seems more promising. {#bottom-up-to-ensure-the-buy-in-and-confidence-of-the-personnel-involved-in-bringing-the-proposed-changes-to-reality-it-will-be-important-to-communicate-the-way-in-which-the-solutions-were-created.-if-the-perception-in-the-organization-is-that-only-the-steering-committee-created-the-proposed-changes-resistance-is-likely-to-occur.-however-if-it-is-understood-that-all-participants-were-consulted-acceptance-seems-more-promising. .ListParagraph}

### **[Middle-Out]{.underline}** Full support at all levels, where the changes will have to be implemented, is important to sustainable improvement. At this level (as with all levels), there must be an effort to find and communicate the specific benefits of the changes. People need a personal stake in the success of the project management practices. {#middle-out-full-support-at-all-levels-where-the-changes-will-have-to-be-implemented-is-important-to-sustainable-improvement.-at-this-level-as-with-all-levels-there-must-be-an-effort-to-find-and-communicate-the-specific-benefits-of-the-changes.-people-need-a-personal-stake-in-the-success-of-the-project-management-practices. .ListParagraph}

**[Communications Outreach]{.underline}** The following is a list of
communication events that are established for this project:

### **[Weekly Team Meeting]{.underline}** These status meetings are held at least once per week and are coordinated by every member. Every member will participates in the meeting. Each individual will communicate status of responsible deliverables. Team will discuss deliverables for the following week and what tasks each member will be working on.

### 

### **[Slack Application Communication]{.underline}** User Group Participants will utilize Slack Application to communicate on concerns or to submit deliverables for review prior to final submission on UMUC classroom. Slack may be updated as frequently as needed and all group members are expected to use it.

**[Trello Board]{.underline}** Team members will divide deliverables
into smaller tasks

and use the Trello cards to track the progress of the task. Documents
will

be submitted for team review and comments using Trello. Trello will be

used to make sure team members understand their deliverables, when

they should be delivered and how long it should take. It will also be
used

to understand what has been completed by team members.
